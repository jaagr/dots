# Available placeholders for song formats:
# %l - length
# %f - filename
# %D - directory
# %a - artist
# %A - album artist
# %t - title
# %b - album
# %y - date
# %n - track number (01/12 -> 01)
# %N - full track info (01/12 -> 01/12)
# %g - genre
# %c - composer
# %p - performer
# %d - disc
# %C - comment
# %P - priority
# $R - begin right alignment
#
# You can also put them in { } and then it will be displayed
# only if all requested values are available and/or define alternate
# value with { }|{ } eg. {%a - %t}|{%f}
#
# Note: Format that is similar to "%a - %t" (i.e. without any additional
# braces) is equal to "{%a - %t}", so if one of the tags is missing,
# you'll get nothing.
#
# Text can also have different color than the main window has,
# eg. if you want length to be green, write $3%l$9
#
# Available values:
# - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
# - 1 - black
# - 2 - red
# - 3 - green
# - 4 - yellow
# - 5 - blue
# - 6 - magenta
# - 7 - cyan
# - 8 - white
# - 9 - end of current color
# - b - bold text
# - u - underline text
# - r - reverse colors
# - a - use alternative character set
#
# If you don't want to use a non-color attribute anymore, just put it
# again, but this time insert character '/' between '$' and attribute
# character, e.g. {$b%t$/b}|{$r%f$/r} will display bolded title tag
# or filename with reversed colors.
#
# If you want to use 256 colors and/or background colors in formats
# (the naming scheme is described below in section about color
# definitions), it can be done with the syntax $(COLOR), e.g. to set
# the artist tag to one of the non-standard colors and make it have
# yellow background, you need to write $(197_yellow)%a$(end). Note
# that for standard colors this is interchangable with attributes
# listed above.
#
# Note: colors can be nested.

# Columns settings {{{

# Syntax of song columns list format is "column column etc."
#
# - syntax for each column is:
#
# (width of column)[column's color]{displayed tag}
#
# Note: Width is by default in %, if you want a column to
# have fixed size, add 'f' after the value, e.g. (10)[white]{a}
# will be the column that take 10% of screen (so the real column's
# width will depend on actual screen size), whereas (10f)[white]{a}
# will take 10 terminal cells, no matter how wide the screen is.
#
# - color is optional (if you want the default one, type [])
#
# Note: You can give a column additional attributes by putting appropriate
# character after displayed tag character. Available attributes are:
#
# - r - column will be right aligned
# - E - if tag is empty, empty tag marker won't be displayed
#
# You can also:
#
# - give a column custom name by putting it after attributes,
#   separated with character ':', e.g. {lr:Length} gives you
#   right aligned column of lengths named "Length".
#
# - define sequence of tags, that have to be displayed in case
#   predecessor is empty in a way similar to the one in classic
#   song format, i.e. using '|' character, e.g. {a|c|p:Owner}
#   creates column named "Owner" that tries to display artist
#   tag and then composer and performter if previous ones are
#   not available.
